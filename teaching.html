<p>I am passionate about teaching and have taught undergraduate or masters level courses during most of the semesters I have been at Berkeley. <p>

<p>I have taught undergraduate courses related to microeconomics, including Industrial Organization, Intermediate Microeconomics, and Psychology and Economics. For these courses, I prepared 1-2 hours of material a week to be taught to discussion sections of students to complement lecture.<p>

<p>I have also taught data analytics to MBA students at Haas. The course focused on teaching students causal inference and machine learning tools appropriate for informing practical business decisions. I prepared weekly lab sections guiding students through applying concepts from lecture in R.<p>
