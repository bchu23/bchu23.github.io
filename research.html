                </ul>
                <p> In 2019, not-for-profit teaching hospitals contributed 45% of all Health Care and Social Assistance GDP. As pricing reform proliferates through the healthcare system, it is important to understand how academic hospitals adjust care quality and teaching in response via the reallocation of patients between residents and non-trainee staff. I leverage unusually detailed electronic health record and audit log data from the emergency department of a large, urban teaching hospital to precisely characterize the static costs of training across a range of detailed patient outcomes and process measures. I find that most patient-relevant metrics do not change with experience, with the exception being patient length of stay for complex patients. In order to understand how the hospital trades off throughput costs with future benefits, I write down and estimate an infinite-horizon dynamic structural model where the hospital chooses the allocation of complex patients in order to maximize the present value of discounted utility. I find that patient allocation can be rationalized by a model where the hospital maximizes training subject to a constraint on patient care quality. Using the model, I find that policies that increase the shadow cost of training, such as a change from FFS to PPS payments, could have negative effects on the outcomes for patients of graduating physicians orders of magnitudes larger than the savings for current patients. Straightforward and feasible remedies such as larger indirect teaching payments or increasing the staffing of attendings can greatly reduce the reduction in training. </p>

                <li>Gender Differences in Non-Promotable Tasks: The Case of Clinical Note-Taking <i> (with Ben Handel, Jon Kolstad, and Ulrike Malmendier) </i> </li>

                <p>
                The use of Electronic Health Records has rapidly proliferated throughout the healthcare industry. In just a few short years, the nature of work has shifted dramatically for physicians in that documentation now makes up a large portion of physicians’ day. Using unusually detailed data from a large urban teaching hospital comprising a comprehensive panel of granular actions by physicians across multiple specialties, we first document that women spend 10% more time writing clinical notes than their male counterparts and write longer notes. We show that these note-taking differences lead to more efficient care for patients admitted to the hospital via the emergency department: there are no differences in patient outcomes but final treatment decisions are reached faster and fewer costly procedures and medications are ordered. Despite these positive outcomes, women physicians are not rewarded for their actions: there are no differences in salary, grants, or publications.

                </ul>
                <p>
                We leverage novel audit log data from the UCSF Emergency Department to study the role of provider fatigue and cognitive load on both provider treatment decisions and patient outcomes. The data have granular physician-patient level data on myriad micro-interactions, such as physician note writing, note reading, order requests and completions, patient test results. We use these data together with the stochastic arrival of patients to the ED to estimate how physician’s workplace burden, in terms of the number of patients they treat and patient complexity, impacts subsequent care for patients that they see. We study physician heterogeneity in the impact of cognitive load and fatigue.
