                <p> When workers and tasks are both heterogeneous and workers learn by doing, how firms and managers allocate tasks to train or exploit workers can lead to considerable differences in both total output and worker skill. This trade-off between investing in tomorrow vs. maximizing output today is especially important in teaching hospitals, where decreases in care quality or quantity could have major consequences for current patients, while decreases in Resident training could have major consequences for future patients. I leverage unusually detailed electronic health record and audit log data to precisely characterize task allocation to Residents belonging to different cohorts, evaluate a range of detailed patient outcomes and process measures, and examine how learning varies with specific tasks performed. I write down and estimate a dynamic structural model to understand the hospital's opportunity costs and long-run benefits and find that patient allocation to Residents is rationalized by a model where the hospital maximizes training subject to a constraint on patient care quality. I find that subsidizing patient care at teaching hospitals could have large benefits over the Residents' careers post-graduation and that relaxing the care constraint could reduce the impact of an exogenous reduction in training as was a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>

                <li>Gender Differences in Non-Promotable Tasks: The Case of Clinical Note-Taking <i> (with Ben Handel, Jon Kolstad, and Ulrike Malmendier) </i> </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                The use of Electronic Health Records has rapidly proliferated throughout the healthcare industry. In just a few short years, the nature of work has shifted dramatically for physicians in that documentation now makes up a large portion of physicians’ day. Using unusually detailed data from a large urban teaching hospital comprising a comprehensive panel of granular actions by physicians across multiple specialties, we first document that women spend 10% more time writing clinical notes than their male counterparts and write longer notes. We show that these note-taking differences lead to more efficient care for patients admitted to the hospital via the emergency department: there are no differences in outcomes but final treatment decisions are reached faster and fewer procedures and medications are ordered. Despite these positive outcomes, women physicians are not rewarded for their actions: there are no differences in salary, grants, or publications. If anything, they are more likely to leave, potentially due to burnout from time spent on documentation.

                </ul>
                <p>
                We leverage novel audit log data from the UCSF Emergency Department to study the role of provider fatigue and cognitive load on both provider treatment decisions and patient outcomes. The data we use have granular physician-patient level data on myriad micro-interactions, including physician notetaking, note reading, order requests, patient tests results and much more. We use these data together with the stochastic arrival of patients to the ED to estimate how physician’s workplace burden, in terms of the number of patients they treat and patient complexity, impacts subsequent care for patients that they see. We study physician heterogeneity in the impact of cognitive load and fatigue.
